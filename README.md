Metro Management System
Metro Management System is an advanced project designed to enhance metro operations through the integration of a C++ backend and a Python GUI. This system focuses on optimizing route planning, fare calculation, and travel duration, aiming to improve both commuter experiences and operational efficiency.

Key Features
C++ Backend: Implements core logic for route planning, fare calculation, and duration estimation using efficient algorithms.
Python GUI: Developed using tkinter, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with the metro management system.
Route Planning: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between metro stations.
Fare Calculation: Computes fares based on distance and other relevant factors.
Travel Duration: Estimates travel time between stations to aid in commuter planning.
Future Web Integration: Plans to develop a comprehensive website using React to enhance accessibility and user experience.
Technologies Used
C++: For core backend logic and algorithm implementation.
Python: For GUI development using tkinter and cpp-python library.
tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating the graphical interface.
React (Future Plan): Frontend framework for developing a dynamic and responsive website.


Getting Started
Prerequisites:

C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: tkinter, cpp-python

Setup:
