# Metro Management System

**Metro Management System** is an advanced project designed to optimize metro operations by integrating a C++ backend with a Python GUI. This system aims to enhance commuter experiences and operational efficiency through improved route planning, fare calculation, and travel duration estimation.

## Key Features

- **C++ Backend**: Manages core functionalities for route planning, fare calculation, and travel duration estimation using efficient algorithms.
- **Python GUI**: Developed with `tkinter`, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Route Planning**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between metro stations.
- **Fare Calculation**: Computes fares based on distance and other relevant factors.
- **Travel Duration**: Estimates travel time between stations to assist in commuter planning.
- **Future Web Integration**: Plans to develop a React-based website to enhance accessibility and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: For implementing core backend logic and algorithms.
- **Python**: For GUI development, using `tkinter` and the `cpp-python` library.
- **tkinter**: Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating the graphical interface.
- **React (Future Plan)**: For developing a dynamic and responsive website.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `tkinter`, `cpp-python`

### Setup

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Install Python 3.x

##Future Enhancements
Website Development: Create a React-based website to provide a better user interaction experience.
Enhanced Algorithms: Implement more advanced algorithms to further improve efficiency and accuracy.
