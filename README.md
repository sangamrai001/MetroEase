Metro Management System
Metro Management System is an advanced project that integrates a C++ backend 
with a Python GUI to manage metro operations efficiently. This system implements efficient 
algorithms for route planning, fare calculation, and travel duration, optimizing both commuter interactions and 
service operations.

Key Features
C++ Backend: Handles the core logic for route planning, fare calculation, and duration estimation using efficient algorithms.
Python GUI: Developed using tkinter, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the metro management system.
Route Planning: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between metro stations.
Fare Calculation: Calculates fares based on distance and other relevant factors.
Travel Duration: Estimates travel time between stations, enhancing commuter planning.
Future Web Integration: Plans to develop a comprehensive website using React for better accessibility and user experience.


Technologies Used
C++: Core backend logic and algorithms.
Python: Interface development with the help of tkinter and cpp-python library.
tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating the graphical interface.
React (Future Plan): Frontend framework for developing a dynamic and responsive website.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: tkinter, cpp-python

Future Enhancements
Website Development: Create a React-based website for better user interaction.
Enhanced Algorithms: Implement more advanced algorithms for better efficiency and accuracy.
